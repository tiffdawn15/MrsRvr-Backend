MrsRvr: 

    The app is going to be the instagram of Mars Rover photos. We are using the NASA's open source data that provides links to images taken by rovers, and rover mission data.  


    User Story: 
    * Homescreen loads with a large image and some details below the image  (Model1). You can click on the image and it will take you to more data on the Rover's mission (Model 2). 

    Gold Version: 
        - Include user accounts with the ability to like a post, this way we can tell which photo is the favorite. 



    Model 1: Rover Photo data  
         - Img-Src : URL 
         - Earth Date : Number
         - Rover ID : Number 
         - Camera Name: String



    Model 2: Rover information 
        - name: String 
        - landing Date: Number 
        - launch Date: Number 
        - Status: Boolean (?)





Question: 
* Can I link the API and make it travel through my models, or do I need to create a JSON? (I want to make sure that we have a bunch of photos )
