# MrsRvr Documentation 


THERE IS LIFE ON MARS!
It's important to listen to this video while reading the documentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZKcl4-tcuo  

The data we used for this API was generously proivded by NASA. (Thanks NASA for everything. Seriosly. Thank you.)

You can find NASA's excellent open source  API here:

Deployed Heroku link to the MrsRvr API:

Description of MrsRvr:   
MrsRvr was intended to be the instagram of MrsRvr pictures. Why? Because the internet needs such a service! This repo is specifically the backend for the MrsRvr website. The deployed API above was used in the frontend of the website. 

Features of Backend: 
* Rover image & mission data 
* Weather data for Sols 292 - 301 (Sol is a Mars day, but it can't be called a day because it is not 24 hours.)
* User Models - Able to register and login 


Technology Used: 
* heroku 
* Express 
* mongoose 
* Node 

Tested API using Postman. 

Full Stack is MERN

GROUND CONTROL TO MAJOR TOM! WE HAVE WEATHER DATA!


   
Weather Data: 

https://mrsrvr.herokuapp.com/weather

Note: This path provides Mars weather data from for SOL 292 to 301. NASA uses only maintains weather data for 7 Sols at time. This data will not be maintained to keep up with NASA's data. 
This data was used in the weather graph on the front end. 





 Note about the Login & Register paths. They both fully functional in the backend, but do not yet work in the frontend. This is due to the worlds dumbest foreach error.
